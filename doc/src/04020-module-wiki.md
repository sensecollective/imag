## Wiki {#sec:modules:wiki}

The Wiki module provides a personal wiki implementation.

The wiki entries are markdown-formatted files in the imag store. All entries are
automatically searched for links and those links are automatically added to the
header (or as external link, depending on the format).

Wiki entries can have no or one category and a arbitrary number of tags.
Entries can be listed (as a "tree" shape) and filtered by content, category and
tag.
